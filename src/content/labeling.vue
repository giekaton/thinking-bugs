      <h3>Instead of saying, “I made a mistake,” you tell yourself, “I’m a jerk” or “I’m a loser”.</h3>

      <p>Labeling is the type of thinking when we describe ourselves or other people by a single label, e.g., “I failed the exam, it means I’m a loser”. The label “loser” used here is an extreme form of overgeneralization and black and white thinking.</p>

      <h4>Example</h4>

      <p>From the early days, Alice saw herself as “bad” because in her childhood mother constantly repeated Alice that she is bad. Throughout her life, when thinking about herself as “bad”, Alice often experienced depression, and it felt like a natural identity to her.</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>It is a thinking error because in reality things are never defined by a single label. Labeling is a cognitive distortion because it contradicts the generally known scientific truths about reality and physical laws.</p>

      <h4>How to fix it?</h4>

      <p>After understanding the mechanics of the Labeling thinking error, and working on her irrational thoughts with the CBT mood logging journal, Alice was able to detach herself from the narrow label “bad” and build a new and more balanced identity.</p>
