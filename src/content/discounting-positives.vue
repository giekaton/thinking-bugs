    <h1>Discounting Positives</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>You insist your positive qualities don’t count.</h3>

      <p>This is often an automatic mind pattern when a person blindly criticizes him or herself without taking into account the positive side of things.</p>

      <p>It is similar to Mental Filter thinking error but has a subtle difference. When engaged in Mental Filtering, a person is not aware of the positives. In the case of Discounting Positives, a person sees the positives but actively rejects and devalues them.</p>

      <p>Most often it is a general thinking habit. It's an automatic mind pattern that influences all aspects of a person’s life.</p>

      <p>It can come from a subconscious negative self-image. To continue identifying with it, a person doesn’t even consider the possibility of finding positives.</p>

      <p>This subconscious error can have a tremendous effect on our lives. When it is attached to our self-image, it limits us significantly in our careers and personal lives and paves the way for other problems and dysfunctions.</p>

      <h4>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </h4>

      <p>Bob got the highest mark for his exam, but in order to keep his negative outlook, he explained the mark as pure luck, having nothing to do with his knowledge and skills.</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>It takes into account only one side of things, completely ignores the other. That's a distortion of reality.</p>
