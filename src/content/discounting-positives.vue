  <div><h1>Discounting Positives</h1> <div>
<h3><strong>You insist your positive qualities don’t count.</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>



<p>This is often an automatic mind pattern when a person blindly criticizes him or herself without even looking at the always possible positive side of things.</p>



<p>Most often it is a general thinking habit, a mind pattern if you will, that influences all aspects of the person’s life.</p>



<p>It can come from a subconscious negative self-image. To continue identifying with it, a person doesn’t even consider the possibility of finding positives.</p>



<p>This subconscious error can have a tremendous effect on our lives. When it is attached to our self-image, it limits us significantly in our careers and personal lives and paves the way for other problems and dysfunctions.</p>
