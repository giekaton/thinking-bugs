    <h1>Discounting Positives</h1>

    <h3>You insist your positive qualities don’t count.</h3>

    <h4>
      <strong>Example</strong>
    </h4>

    <p>Bob got the highest mark for his exam, but in order to keep his negative outlook, he explained the mark as pure luck, having nothing to do with his knowledge and skills.</p>

    <h4>Explained</h4>

    <p>This is often an automatic mind pattern when a person blindly criticizes him or herself without taking into account the positive side of things.</p>

    <p>It is similar to Mental Filter thinking error but has a subtle difference. When engaged in Mental Filtering, a person is not aware of the positives. In the case of Discounting Positives, a person sees the positives but actively rejects or devalues them.</p>

    <p>Most often it is a general thinking habit. It's an automatic mind pattern that influences all aspects of a person’s life.</p>

    <p>It can come from a subconscious negative self-image. To continue identifying with it, a person doesn’t even consider the possibility of finding positives.</p>

    <p>This subconscious error can have a tremendous effect on our lives. When it is attached to our self-image, it limits us significantly in our careers and personal lives and paves the way for other problems and dysfunctions.</p>

      How to fix it
    </h4>

    
      <p>
        You can fix your thinking bugs by using the classical technique of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Here, it is digitized into the <a href="https://thinkingbugs.com/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT App</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought needs to be written down in the thought record using the mood logging technique, then challenged and rewritten in a rational, and realistically positive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        This technique doesn't work if you keep thoughts in the head. The thought needs to be written down in the thought record and then challenged, by spotting and fixing the thinking errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the errors in a written thought are found, they need to be challenged one by one. The distorted thought needs to be rewritten in a new way for each cognitive distortion. Then the bug can be marked as fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Write the dysfunctional thought in the <a href="https://thinkingbugs.com/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT mood logging app</a>. Identify the Discounting Positives thinking bug. Then rewrite the thought more realistically, considering other possible interpretations of the situation.
