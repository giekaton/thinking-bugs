      <h4>Explained</h4>

      <p>
        The last thinking error encompasses different types of magical thinking. These thinking bugs may or may not be part of the classical CBT, but are well-known cognitive distortions. When working with the CBT app, this 12-th thinking bug can be ignored.
      </p>

      <p><br>"The Fallacy of Fairness" - you think things should work out according to what you think is fair or according to the storylines from popular books or movies where there is always a happy end.</p>

      <p><br>"If Only" - You think everything will be better when you're thinner, smarter, richer, get a new job etc. The error is in the fact that you are ignoring the current reality and instead concentrating on your imagination how everything would be better if only this or that.</p>

      <p>You can either accept the situation, or you can improve your life conditions by actively working towards your goals, and not wasting time and energy engaged in magical thinking.</p>

      <p><br>"Control Tendencies" - You believe in the popular idea of "free will" and assume that your achievements or failures are direct results of your actions. Alternatively, you believe that everything is pre-destined (or it's God's will) and you are powerless.</p>
        
      <p>The reality is much more complex than these basic assumptions. You are neither all-powerful nor powerless, as there are many different influences, causes and effects that are out of your control.</p>

      <p><br>In the future, Magical Thinking errors group will be updated with additional bugs, such as "Supperstitions", "Correlation doesn't Imply Causation" and others.</p>

      <!-- <p><br>"Superstitions" - Coming soon...</p>

      <p><br>"Correlation doesn't Imply Causation" - Coming soon...</p> -->

      <!-- Magical thinking, together with some other types of thinking bugs, can be used efficiently to increase creativity... -->


      <h4>How to fix it</h4>

      <p>As mentioned above, this is the extra bug, outside of the classical CBT range. When spotted, Magical Thinking bugs can be fixed similarly as other CBT thinking errors.</p>
