      Magical Thinking
    </h1>
    
    <h3>Different types of irrational and unrealistic thinking.</h3>

    <p>Magical thinking is a group of different thinking types that aim at explaining the world without taking into account the actual cause and effect relationships of reality.</p>

    <p>Superstitions are the clearest example of this type of thinking. A black cat has crossed a street, and in many cultures, we are inclined to think that this is a bad sign, while there is no actual evidence that black cats, in particular, are causing damage.</p>

    <h4>The Fallacy of Fairness</h4>

    <p>You believe that things should work out according to what you think is fair or according to storylines from popular books or movies.</p>

    <p>The truth is that objective reality is meaningless, and only we humans can create and attach meaning to it. While it is a great thing to strive for fairness, it is not always possible. The understanding that reality is neither fair or unfair, that it is indifferent - is a good starting point that empowers us to build a truly meaningful life.</p>

    <i>"Paradox as it may seem, we likewise find life meaningful only when we have seen that it is without purpose, and know the ‘mystery of the universe’ only when we are convinced that we know nothing about it at all." – The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety, Alan W. Watts</i>


    <h4>If Only</h4>

    <p>
      You think everything will be better when you're thinner, smarter, richer, get a new job, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The error is in the fact that you are ignoring the current reality and instead - concentrating on a fantasy where everything can better if only this or that. This can make you unproductive, lazy, depressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If life's situation is unchangeable, acceptance of the situation is the right thing to do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And if the situation can be changed, you can choose to try to change it by actively working towards your goals.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Control Tendencies
    </h4>

    <p>
      You believe in the popular idea of "free will" and assume that your achievements or failures are direct results of your actions. Alternatively, you believe that everything is pre-destined, or it's God's will, and you are powerless.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The reality is more complex and nuanced than these basic assumptions. You are neither all-powerful nor powerless, as there are many different influences, causes and effects that are out of your control.
    </p>


    <h4>Fear of Thinking</h4>

    <p>
      The belief that just by thinking about the thought, it will materialize.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is true that by thinking about a particular thing, we can increase the likelihood of that thing becoming a reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      This phenomenon comes under different names, such as "selective attention", "law of attraction", "self-fulfilling prophecy", and can be strengthened through affirmations and "fake until you make it" approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      It works for both positive and negative thoughts, and that's why some people are extremely fearful about being open-minded, or they experience fear and anxiety when a negative thought comes uninvited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Accepting the existence of the thought, even if it's negative, allowing it to be, and knowing that the though is not the same as action, will let the thought "to dance its dance", and then it will subside and pass away if it has no value to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, if you try to avoid the thought at any cost, this avoidance can make the thought stronger, because by actively trying to avoid the thought, you are also actively thinking about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The understanding that the thought is not the same as the action is an extremely important one. It allows you to be aware of the field of different possible scenarios about the future. By seeing a wide range of possibilities, you can learn or have insights from negative scenarios, but aim for the best possible future outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, the acceptance of a thought, without the need to act on it, creates a space between the thought and the action, where you have the power to choose your reaction instead of reacting automatically.

      How to fix Magical Thinking bugs
    </h4>

    <p>
      Magical Thinking bugs may not be part of the classical Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but are well-known cognitive distortions. That is why when working with the CBT app, this 12th thinking bug can be ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though this is an extra set of bugs that are outside of the classical CBT range, when spotted, Magical Thinking bugs can be fixed similarly as other thinking errors - using the <router-link to="/cbt-app">CBT app</router-link>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, if you have fixed all your bugs and took control of your thinking, you can now use the Magical Thinking together with some other types of thinking bugs to increase creativity or to benefit from them in some other ways, e.g. write a book, become an entrepreneur, create an app, help others to challenge their negative thoughts, and similar.
