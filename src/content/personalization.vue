  <div class="site-content"><div><h1><span>Personalization</span></h1> <div>
  <h3>Personalization (or self-absorption) is the tendency to consider negative events or irrelevant events as having something (negative) to do with you.</h3>



  <p>The mind produces this thinking error when the person thinks that he/she is somehow related to some negative or irrelevant events when he/she actually isn’t.</p>



  <p>Through the error of Personalization, a lot of negative thought patterns can develop. It’s like an entry point for the negative storyline.</p>



  <p>A person can associate some outer event with the internal negative thought pattern about him or herself and then build other concepts based on this thinking error.</p>



  <p>The outer event doesn’t even need to be negative. It can be first Personalized and then to make it negative, other thinking errors can be added on top.</p>
