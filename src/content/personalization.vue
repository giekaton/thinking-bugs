      <h3>Personalization (or self-absorption) is the tendency to consider negative events or irrelevant events as having something (negative) to do with you.</h3>

      <p>This thinking error occurs when the person thinks that he or she is somehow related to some negative or irrelevant events or bears responsibiltiy for them, when this is actually not the case.</p>

      <p>Through the error of Personalization, a lot of negative thought patterns can develop. It’s like an entry point for the negative storyline.</p>

      <p>A person can associate some outer event with the internal negative thought pattern about him or herself and then build other concepts based on this thinking error.</p>

      <p>The outer event doesn’t even need to be negative. It can be first Personalized and then to make it negative, other thinking errors can be added on top.</p>

      <p>This thining error comes from our early childhood. A child thinks that he is the center of the world, and if things happen (e.g. the mother is sad or happy), the child thinks that it is he or she who is responsible for the monther's mood.</p>
    
      <p>On the flip side, Personalization can also be a positive distortion. When it's positive, it create a pompous and inadequate personality that attaches events to his or her personality and interprets everything in an irrationally positive way.</p>

      <h4>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </h4>

      <p>Alice caught an angry look from the supermarket's cashier, and started believing the thought that she did something wrong. Actually the cashier was having a bad day, and was angry at everyone.</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>Sometimes things can be trully personal. It's an error when a person has a tendency to think that most of the things are related to him or her personally.</p>
