        <h3>You blow things way out of proportion or shrink them.</h3>

        <p>Magnification or Minimization is an inadequate reaction to an outside object or event.</p>

        <p>It is a well known fact that many people magnify their failures. They keep thinking about the same thing again and again, and make a big deal out of it.  Something, that could have been easily ignored at the beginning, sticks and grows, and becomes a real thing – a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, magnification is a dramatization, and it is a result of over-thinking.</p>

        <p>Thinking is a great instrument, but when it's left on auto-pilot, in many cases it creates more harm than value.</p>

        <p>People also tend to minify their good qualities, achievements and other positive things about life. A meaningful personal achievement goes unnoticed (minification), while a minor failure becomes an all-consuming object of worry (magnification).</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

        <p>When a person is deeply involved in his or her thinking, it can be very hard to step aside and take a fresh look at the situation. The thoughts feel so real, but they are not.</p>

        <p>Thoughts are just an interpretation of reality, not the actual reality.</p>

        <h4>How to fix it?</h4>
