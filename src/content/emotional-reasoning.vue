    <h1>Emotional Reasoning</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>You reason from your feelings: “I feel like an idiot, so I must be one.”</h3>

      <p>This is a very unique thinking error, and an interesting phenomenon to explore. It connects the feeling with the thought.</p>

      <p>A person feels bad, and as a consequence thinks bad. This thinking then amplifies the feeling.</p>

      <p>The thought process goes like this: “I feel bad, therefore there should be something wrong with me”.</p>

      <p>When you start looking for negatives, you will most definitely find them. When engaged in emotional reasoning, the person starts searching for negatives in the form of a question “what’s wrong with me?”.</p>

      <p>Emotional negativity can be felt because of many reasons, some of them can be hard to explain, others – an indirect sign of progress, or arising from some natural life challenges. Emotional suffering can be legitimate, and in this case, it is important to accept it and grow that way.</p>

      <p>When it is an error, it’s a different thing which can be fixed, and as a consequence, living conditions improved.</p>

        Some people have so many physical aches and pains, and without any concrete medical reason, so that specialists suggest them to ignore (through acceptance) the symptoms all together. Best self-help books on this subject are written by

      <h4>Example</h4>

      <p>After a hard day at work, Bob came home and got into a conflict with his children. There was no reason for the conflict, Bob just felt bad after the hard day at work, and wanted to do something about it.</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>The emotional discomfort creates the urge to act. Such action is often unnecessary and harmful, especially when it arises not from the situation at hand but from some internal conflict, or previous experiences.</p>

      <h4>How to fix it?</h4>

      <p>
        First of all, it is important to challenge the thought using the

      <p>For some people, this rational understanding of the dysfunctional process can create a permanent change.</p>

        For others, it may require additional emotional healing. First, challenging the irrational thought, but then accepting the emotional discomfort, maybe with the help of

        Emotional discomfort can be felt in/with the body. When you understand that there is no rational reason for it, with the continuous practice the feeling/sensation can then be felt in its pure form, without adding additional conceptualization on top of it.
        <br />
        <br />Without giving it additional energy from thought, the feeling arises, is being felt for a while, and then it passes away.
