    <div class="site-content"><div><h1><span>Overgeneralization</span></h1> <div>
    <h3>You view a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. </h3>



    <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>



    <p>This thinking error happens when the mind makes a universal rule out of a single isolated event. It’s a broad conclusion about life in general, derived from a tiny detail.</p>



    <p>This is a form of lazy thinking. Instead of openly investigating possible alternatives and trying to better understand the whole picture, the mind decides that it’s enough – “I now know it all”.</p>



    <h4><strong>Example</strong></h4>



    <p>Bob has once won a lottery. He overgeneralized that the particular store where he bought the ticket and the particular time of a day was his lucky combination. Throughout years Bob continued to buy tickets at the same place and at the same time of a day but never won again.</p>



    <h4>Why is it a thinking error?</h4>



    <p>It is a thinking error because it contradicts the basic facts we know about life, and it’s also a logical fallacy.</p>



    <h4><strong>How to fix it</strong>?</h4>



    <p>Take a fresh look at the situation. Do you see any other details besides the single overgeneralized conclusion that the mind had made? Challenge the thought by rewriting it in a more realistic and rational way, considering the possible positive alternatives, looking at the situation individually, and not trying to make a general rule about life.</p>
