<h3>You predict that things will turn out badly. </h3>



<h4>Description</h4>



<p>As the name of this cognitive distortion suggests, fortune telling is when we try to predict the future and believe our predictions as if they are true.</p>



<p>Fortune telling can be negative, or positive.</p>



<h4>Example</h4>



<p>Bob is convinced that the relationship with Alice will have a bad end, therefore he is already preparing for it, and has an overall negative outlook on the relationship.</p>



<h4>Why is it a thinking error? </h4>



<p>It is a well-known fact in psychology and general science that people cannot predict the future.</p>



<p>People try predicting things professionally (actuaries, investment advisors, researchers, sci-fi authors), but thatâ€™s not what we are talking about.</p>



<p>When we are talking about the thinking error of Fortune Telling, the prediction is not based on data, it is often subjective, made on an individual level. Most of the time the individual is not even aware that he or she made the prediction and is doing the Fortune Telling error.</p>



<h4>How to fix it?</h4>



<p>When using the <a href="https://thinkingerrors.org/cbt-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CBT app (opens in a new tab)">CBT app</a>, inspect your thought. Are your future predictions based on data, do they have rational foundations, are they true?</p>



<p>If not sure, ask a friend or consult with a CBT specialist.</p>
