      About the Thinking Bugs
    </h1>

    <div style="height:10px;"></div>

    <p>Thinking Bugs is a web-app where you will find the classical cognitive distortions list (also referred to as "bugs" or "errors") and the CBT app to fix your thinking 🐛🐞💥.</p>

    <p>The list of thinking errors and the CBT app are based on classical Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>

    <p>Being a Progressive Web App (PWA), Thinking Bugs can be <span @click="installPWA()" class="link">installed</span> on most mobile and desktop devices and used even without the internet.</p>

    <p>Thinking Bugs project is created by <a href="https://giekaton.com" target='_blank'>Gie Katon</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The CBT App and the thinking errors list are in early beta. The app can already be used fully but the thinking errors content still needs updates and improvements. Feel free to suggest content editions and ideas for new features.</p>

    <div style="height:15px;"></div>

    <p>Interested to learn more? Consider the possibility of a bug with the ability to think, you know, the thinking bug. Sounds unrealistic. As far as we know, animals, insects, and other beings cannot think. Only humans can.</p>

    <p>Thinking is a blessing but also a curse. Uncontrolled thinking leads to depression or other problems.</p>

    <p><i>"Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people’s thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy."
    <br>
    – Eckhart Tolle</i></p>

    <div style="height:15px;"></div>

    <p>Is this constant, unstoppable, repeated thinking bugging you? Does it bug you? Most likely, yes. Anxiety, depression, anger, and similar common experiences are results of the thinking bugs. Some of the negative experiences are legitimate but a person with lots of thinking errors is suffering because of his or her own mind.</p>

    <p>There are two helpful metaphors that you can use when working with your thinking bugs.
    
    <div style="height:15px;"></div>

    <p><b>Garden metaphor</b></p>  
    
    <p>Imagine that your mind and its thinking processes are like a garden, where good things can grow. As in every garden, if not taken care of, weeds will overtake and bugs will start to dominate your garden. Your mind, like the garden, needs care and the CBT app is here to help you.</p>

    <div style="height:45px;"></div>

    <p><b>Computer metaphor</b></p>  

    <p>Prominent artificial intelligence scientists believe that human intelligence (the "thinking" part) can be compared to an extremely powerful and sophisticated computer. Like any other computer, our thinking can also have bugs.</p>
    
    <p>Because the computer metaphor is relevant and appropriate, in all thinking errors examples you will see the names Bob and Alice, the same names that are traditionally used in cryptography to describe encrypted interactions.</p>

    <div style="height:45px;"></div>

    <p>The app's intention is to make fixing bugs look like a fun thing, not a hard work. No doubt, it can be very hard to work with our thinking errors, face challenges, and practice new ways of thinking and living. We do not want to stress this "hard work" even more, but instead, to make this process user friendly and gamified.</p>

    <div style="height:25px;"></div>

    <b>IMPORTANT:</b> To those who do not know the CBT mood logging technique and are not familiar with the core principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The information currently available on Thinking Bugs website is not complete. We highly recommend you to refer to classical books about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336" target="_blank">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a> by Dr. David D. Burns. You can then use the CBT app way more efficiently.
