<div class="site-content"><div><h1><span>Jumping to Conclusions</span></h1> <div>
<h3>You jump to conclusions not warranted by the facts. </h3>



<h4>Description</h4>



<p>We make this thinking error when our mind creates a generalized conclusion about some future situation. The conclusion is often irrational and unrealistic.</p>



<p>This thinking error is in action when the mind cannot tolerate the unknown. It rushes to the conclusion and fills the empty space with any answer it can find.</p>



<p>For many people, it is often easier to accept even the negative conclusion than to tolerate the unknown in which both positive and negative outcomes are possible.</p>



<p>When a person makes a negative conclusion, thoughts about failure can result in real-life failure because what we think about often gets energized and manifests in real life.</p>



<p>Jumping to Conclusions results in a self-inflicted defeat when it’s negative, and when positive – in unrealistic illusions and over-confidence.</p>



<h4>Example</h4>



<p>—</p>



<h4>Why is it a thinking error? </h4>



<p>The thinking error of Jumping to Conclusions has no scientific basis – no one can predict the future. It is an irrational belief and an inaccurate distortion of reality.</p>



<h4>How to fix it?</h4>



<p>Metaphorically speaking, do not allow your mind to take such gigantic leaps of faith (straight to the all-encompassing conclusion), especially when there is no rational basis.</p>
