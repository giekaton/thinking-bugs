      <h3>You assume that people are reacting negatively to you.</h3>

      <p>It is a belief that we know what the other person is thinking.</p>

      <p>This sometimes can be accurate, because we can interpret body language.</p>

      <p>When it’s a thinking error, the Mind Reading is often inaccurate and irrational and is done on an individual level. Most often it is negative, but it also has its positive form.</p>

      <h4>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </h4>

      <p>Alice looked at Bob in a strange way. Bob concluded that Alice doesn’t like his appearance and doesn’t love him. Actually, at that particular moment, Alice was thinking if and when he is going to propose her.</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>Unless it’s a movie or a sci-fi novel, people cannot read other people’s mind. That’s a known scientific truth.</p>
