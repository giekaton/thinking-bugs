      <h3>You assume that people are reacting negatively to you.</h3>

      <h4>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </h4>

      <p>Alice looked at Bob in a strange way. Bob concluded that Alice doesn’t like his appearance and has no good feelings for him. Actually, at that particular moment, Alice was thinking when, if ever, Bob is going invite her to a date.</p>

      <h4>Explained</h4>

      <p>It is a belief that we know what the other person is thinking.</p>

      <p>This sometimes can be accurate, because we can interpret body language.</p>

      <p>When it’s a thinking error, the Mind Reading is not based on data, done automatically and on individual level. Most often it is negative, but it also has its positive form.</p>

      <p>Unless it’s a movie or a sci-fi novel, people cannot read other people’s mind. That’s a known scientific truth.</p>

      <h4>
        <strong>How to fix it</strong>
      </h4>

      <p>
        You can fix your thinking bugs by using the classical technique of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Here, it is digitized into the <a href="https://thinkingbugs.com/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT App</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought needs to be written down in the thought record using the mood logging technique, then challenged and rewritten in a rational, and realistically positive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        This technique doesn't work if you keep thoughts in the head. The thought needs to be written down in the thought record and then challenged, by spotting and fixing the thinking errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the errors in a written thought are found, they need to be challenged one by one. The distorted thought needs to be rewritten in a new way for each cognitive distortion. Then the bug can be marked as fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Write the dysfunctional thought in the <a href="https://thinkingbugs.com/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT thought record</a>. Identify the Mind Reading thinking bug. Then rewrite the thought more realistically, considering other possible interpretations of the situation.
