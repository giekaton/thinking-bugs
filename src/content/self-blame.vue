      <h3>You blame yourself for something you weren’t entirely responsible for.</h3>

      <p>Humans develop their self-image early in life, and some people see themselves as in one or another way faulty, not because of objective reasons, but because it’s their self-concept.</p>

      <p>The thinking error of Self Blame points to this habitual thinking pattern, gives it a name and allows it to be spotted more easily.</p>

      <h4>Example</h4>

      <p>Bob always immediately assumed that he did something wrong when any person gave him even a slightly bad look.</p>

      <p>“That person is not happy with me. Probably I did something wrong.”</p>

      <h4>Why is this a thinking error?</h4>

      <p>There can be many reasons why things happen in life. It is irrational to assume that the first one to blame is always “me”. Maybe the other person has issues, or the whole situation is wrong and unhealthy.</p>

      <p>For an individual doing this error, it is important to understand that it is not always he or her who is bad, even though someone may want to position the situation that way.</p>

      <p>For the individual, it is important to acknowledge that other people and situations can be bad too. For people with self-blame tendencies, this can be hard to do, and they can be manipulated by aggressive people, who operate using fear.</p>
