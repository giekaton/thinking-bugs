      Self Blame
    </h1>
    
    <h3>You blame yourself for something you weren’t entirely responsible for.</h3>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <p>Bob always immediately assumed that he did something wrong when any person gave him even a slightly bad look.</p>

    <p>“That person is not happy with me. Probably I did something wrong.”</p>

    <h4>Explained</h4>

    <p>Humans develop their self-image early in life, and some people learn to see themselves as faulty or bad. Not because of objective reasons, but because it’s their self-concept.</p>

    <p>The thinking error of the Self Blame points to this habitual thinking pattern, gives it a name and allows it to be spotted more easily.</p>

    <p>There can be many reasons why things happen in life. It is irrational to assume that the first one to blame is always “me”. Maybe the other person has issues, or the whole situation is in some ways wrong.</p>

    <p>For an individual doing this error, it is important to understand that it is not always he or her who is bad.</p>

    <p>For the individual, it is important to acknowledge that other people and situations can be bad too. For people with self-blame tendencies, this can be hard to do, and they can be manipulated by others, who compete using the <a href="/other-blame" target="_blank">Other Blame</a> strategies.</p>


    <h4>How to fix it</h4>

    <p>
      You can fix your thinking bugs with the help of the <a href="https://thinkingbugs.com/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT app</a> - a digital version of the classical Cognitive Behavioral Therapy practice.
    </p>

    <p>
