        <h3>You dwell on the negatives and ignore the positives.</h3>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>Alice was in her garden, taking care of plants. She was working there from early morning, feeling great and did a lot of good work that day, even more than planned. Then she accidentally stepped on a newly planted tomato. It didn't survive. Alice got an instant inner reaction blaming herself how could she do this. Despite the fact that more than 50 tomato plants were planted and a lot of other good work done, the whole weekend she was ruminating about the tomato plant she stepped upon. This was going to an absurd, but even years later, she was still recalling that event and feeling "down" during those moments.</p>

        <h4>Explained</h4>

        <p>The Mental Filter is a distortion of reality through a tendency to interpret things negatively.</p>

        <p>A person doing this error is not seeing the positive aspects of the situation and instead is concentrating only on the negatives.</p>

        <p>
          When the Mental Filter is in action, it is also accompanied by the phenomenon of selective attention. It narrows the worldview, concentrating on the negative things or events, or interpreting neutral things as negative.
        </p>

        <p>For some people, mental filtering is a character quality, linked to the person’s identity. After practicing CBT journaling technique with different situations, the thinking error of mental filtering can be changed to a more healthy and positive worldview.</p>

        <p>Cognitive distortions can be both positive and negative. When the Mental Filter is irrationally positive, it creates inadequately positive expectations. As they are unrealistic, they finally conclude to negative results. The metaphor for this is “seeing things through the rose-tinted glasses”.</p>

        <p>The Mental Filter creates an irrational worldview that is not adequate or realistic because it goes through an artificial mental tendency to shape things in one way or another.</p>

        <p>In some cases, this can work and can be practiced intentionally. For example, there is the phrase “fake it until you make it”. But if a person is suffering from automatic mental filtering, first there is a need to regain freedom and control over it. Then it may be used in new creative and practically applicable ways.</p>
