<h3>You dwell on the negatives and ignore the positives. </h3>



<h4>Description</h4>



<p>The Mental Filter is a distortion of reality through a tendency to interpret things negatively.</p>



<p>A person doing this error is often ignoring the positive aspects of the situation and concentrating only on the negative ones.</p>



<p>When the Mental Filter is in action, it is also accompanied by the phenomenon of <em>selective-attention</em>. It narrows the worldview, concentrating on the negative things or events, or interpreting neutral things as negative.</p>



<p>For some people, mental filtering is a character quality, linked to a person’s identity. After practicing CBT journaling technique with different situations, the thinking error of mental filtering can be changed to a more healthy and positive worldview.</p>



<p>Cognitive distortions can be both positive and negative. When the Mental Filter is positive, it creates inadequately positive expectations, that are unrealistic, and finally conclude to negative results. It is like “seeing things through rose-tinted glasses”.</p>



<h4>Example</h4>



<p>—</p>



<h4>Why is it a thinking error?</h4>



<p>The Mental Filter creates an irrational worldview which is not adequate or realistic because it goes through an artificial mental tendency to see things in one way or another.</p>



<p>In some cases, it can work and can be practiced intentionally. For example, there is a phrase “fake it until you make it”. But that’s the next level. If a person is suffering from mental filtering, first there is a need to regain freedom and control over it, only then it can be used in new creative and practically applicable ways.</p>



<h4>How to fix it?</h4>



<p>Write the negative thought in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CBT journal (opens in a new tab)" href="https://thinkingerrors.org/cbt-app" target="_blank">CBT journal</a>, and then challenge it. Is there a mental filter in action? It can be seen clearly when the thought is written in text.</p>



<p>The person then needs to rewrite the thought in a more realistic way, without indulging in a negative or positive mental filtering.</p>



<p>Sometimes it can be hard for someone to self-analyze him or herself. In such cases, it is often recommended to seek help from a professional CBT specialist, who can help to make insights and then to challenge the thinking errors.</p>
